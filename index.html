        The Labrador Retriever, or just Labrador, is a large breed of retriever-gun dog. The Labrador is
        one of the most popular breeds of dog in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.
        A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid
        those with blindness or autism, act as a therapy dog, or perform screening and detection work
        for law enforcement and other official agencies.
        Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.

        The modern Labrador's ancestors originated on the island of Newfoundland, now part of the
        province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
        The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's water dog, a breed that emerged
        through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century.
        The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known, but were likely a random-bred mix of
        English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater
        Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the
        island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th
        century.
        The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was
        used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of
        the Labrador Retriever.

    <h2 id="temperment" style="text-align: center;">Temperment</h2>
    <p>
        Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog.
        This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines,
        particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the
        field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving
        boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it
        does not get out of hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic.
        Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years
        of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often
        mislabelled as being hyperactive.
        Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-
        grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of
        activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).

    <p>
        In the United States, the breed gained wider recognition following a 1928 American Kennel
        Gazette article, "Meet the Labrador Retriever". Before this time, the AKC had only registered 23
        Labradors in the country, in part because US and UK hunting styles had different requirements.
        Labradors acquired popularity as hunting dogs during the 1920s and especially after World War
        II, as they gained recognition as combining some of the best traits of the two favourite United
        States breeds as both game finders and water dogs.
        Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the
        Russian Retriever Club traces the arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as household pets of
        diplomats and others in the foreign ministry.
        The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR)
        was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved,
        leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; at the start of the 1980s, home-born
        dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas.
        Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of
        retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have
        helped this situation become regularised.
